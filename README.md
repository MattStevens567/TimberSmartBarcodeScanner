TimberSmart Barcode Scanner

This is a Barcode Scanning app which stores scanned barcodes which can then be exported by csv for use on TimberSmarts Inventory System.

This app will be used in conjunction with a barcode scanner attached to a pole which will scan the barcodes into the app for processing/storage.

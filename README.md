TimberSmart StickBarcodeScanner
This is a Barcode Scanning app which talks to TimberSmart's inventory management system.
The barcode scanner will be attached at the end of a stick to scan timber which is too high to reach.
This will help TimberSmart's clients in various ways.
This is the first development cycle of this app.
